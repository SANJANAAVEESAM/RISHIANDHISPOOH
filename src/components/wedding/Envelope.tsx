 * Scene 1 — the couple's illustration behind frosted glass, with the monogram
 * over it.
 *
 * Deliberately still: tapping hands straight over to the hero, and the overlay
 * in index.tsx cross-fades the two. There is no clearing or focusing sequence
 * in between — the guest should reach the invitation, not watch an animation.
 *
 * The illustration sits at scale 1, exactly where the page's fixed backdrop
 * sits, so it stays registered through the cross-fade and only the frost and
 * monogram dissolve.
